<h2>Description</h2>
<p>Super simple macaroni and cheese to make without having to make a white sauce! I have a casserole 
    setting on my microwave and use that. Takes only 20 minutes.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>1 (10.5 ounce) can condensed cream of mushroom soup (such as Campbell’s)</li>
    <li>1 ¼ cups milk</li>
    <li>½ cup shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    <li>1 ½ cups macaroni</li>
</ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Cook pasta in a large pot of boiling salted water until al dente. Drain.</li>
    <li>Mix together condensed soup and cheese. Using the empty soup can, measure 1 can of milk; mix into the 
        soup mixture. Stir in cooked pasta. Dump into a greased casserole dish, and cover.</li>
    <li>Bake at 325 degrees F (165 degrees C) until hot and bubbly, about 30 minutes.</li>
  </ol>
